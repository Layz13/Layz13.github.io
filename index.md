# My Little Static Site

I created this Static site through github **Amazing!** 

I am very excited about making this through Github. I am following this [Tutorial](https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/static-websites/) as a part of the HIST5706 class. I am truly enjoying making a static site and learning how to make all of these cool techy things!

I am really _proud_ of somehow being able to do this!
